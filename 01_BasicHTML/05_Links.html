<!--	LINKS

		Websites wouldn't be very interesting if you couldn't get from one to another. This
		network of connections is why we call it 'the web'.

		A link is created with in several parts:
			+ the 'anchor' tag or <a>
			+ the URL within the anchor tag with the attribute 'href'
			+ the link's text that the user sees

		For example:
			<a href='http://www.amazon.com'>Amazon</a>

		Anything can be a link! Text, images, sections of the page...

			A basic link sends to you to another page; the code is 'inline', or within
			the line of text.  The anatomy of a link:

			<br /><br />
			
			<!-- 	note, we have to use special characters for the < and > so they
				 	don't make a real link! see '04_TextFormatting.html' for more info -->
			
			<code>  &lt;a href="anotherPage.html"&gt;the text that will be a link&lt;/a&gt;</code>
		</p>

		<p>
			<!--	link to another page in the same folder -->
			Links to <a href="01_FirstPageEver.html">internal pages</a>, in the same folder, can be listed as simply the filename.
			
			<br /><br />

			<!--	link to a page (or other item) in a subfolder -->
			To link into a <a href="example-of-a-subfolder/catguitar.gif">subfolder</a> (perhaps of images), use the <code>nameOfFolder/nameOfFile.extension</code>

			<br /><br />

			<!--	link to a page on another site -->
			Links to <a href="http://www.amazon.com">external pages</a> (on another site) should always include the full URL including
			the <code>http://</code> part.
