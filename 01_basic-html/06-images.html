<!--	IMAGES
		Jeff Thompson | 2012-13 | www.jeffreythompson.org

		It's not 1995 anymore - websites are full of images!

		Images are linked, similar to the <a> tag used for normal links but using
		the <img> tag, specifying the image using the 'src' attribute. 

		For example:
			<img src='my-super-cool-image.png'>

		IMAGE TYPES
		While other formats are sometimes usable on different browsers, the
		following are the most common and widely used image formats for the web.
		+ jpg		most common - somewhat harsher compression, no transparency
		+ png		smoother compression (and my fave), allows transparency
		+ gif		less common, allows transparency, old school but can be animated!

		COMPRESSION
		Images for the web should be as small as possible:
		+ 72 pixels per inch (ppi), since most monitors can't display higher resolution
		+ sized for your use - if the page is only 700px wide, resize your image
		+ use the 'Save for web...' option in Photoshop - files should be well under
		  1MB, preferably in the 300-500k range
